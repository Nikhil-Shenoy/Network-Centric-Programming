I did not implement any separate functions from the ones given because I though that a sequential program was enough.

I begin the proxy by checking for proper usage. Following that, I enter an infinite while loop that will continuously read requests. The log file is opened, and then the three-way handshake is performed to make sure the connection exists. I then check to see if a port number exists in the given URI, and if it exists, I store it as well as the other parameters. If not, I record just the other parameters I need and set the default to 80. I construct the request, and send it to the server. I loop until all the content is received, and make a log entry every time a new response is sent back from the host. Finally, I forward all of the responses back to the browser and wait for a new request.
