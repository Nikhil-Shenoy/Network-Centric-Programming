1) Write proxy server that accepts a connection from a web browser and simply prints the entire request message from the web-browser on the screen.

2) Extend the server from 1 to extract the browswer IP and URL information from the request message. Open a log file and write this information into a file, instead of printing the message to the screen. Use the provided function to format the output. Set size to 0, since it is unknown at this point

3) Write separate client that takes a URL as input and prints out the web server response for that URL as well as the size of the response in bytes.

4) Combine the server and client into a single program. Instead of having the client print the output on the screen, feed it back to the web browser.
