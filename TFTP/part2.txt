					Requirements for TFTP 2


Socket() and Bind() use one port
The response uses ANOTHER port. Call socket() again to send the reply using a different file descriptor. Close that socket once the message is sent. Then listen using recvfrom on the original packet.


Part 1:
	- Implement the download (response to RRQ) for binary mode using an iterative server
	- One request served at a time
	- Server should check whether file exists in the working directory
		- If not, return previously constructed error packet
		- If yes, download the file
	- Provide command line option to set the port number
	- Make sure that the file downloads to a directory that is separate from the one you are working in.

Part 2:
	- Implement a concurrent server to serve multiple connections using I/O Multiplexing


To Do:
	- The response uses ANOTHER port. Call socket() again to send the reply using a different file descriptor. Close that socket once the message is sent. Then listen using recvfrom on the original packet.
	-  Provide command line option to set the port number
	- Implement a concurrent server to serve multiple connections using I/O Multiplexing




Tips:
	- Put sleep(1) in between each transmission of a packet.
	- Use netstat and tcpdump to check the packets
