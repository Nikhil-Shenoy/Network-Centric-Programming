					Requirements for TFTP 2


Part 1:
	- Implement the download (response to RRQ) for binary mode using an iterative server
	- One request served at a time
	- Server should check whether file exists in the working directory
		- If not, return previously constructed error packet
		- If yes, download the file
	- Provide command line option to set the port number
	- Make sure that the file downloads to a directory that is separate from the one you are working in.

Part 2:
	- Implement a concurrent server to serve multiple connections using I/O Multiplexing



Tips:
	- Put sleep(1) in between each transmission of a packet.
	- Use netstat and tcpdump to check the packets
