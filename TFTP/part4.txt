- Select waits for datagram socket to become ready, then returns. Called before recvfroma



Basic outline:
	1) Declare an fd_set variable
	2) Set all the bits to zero using FD_ZERO
	3) Set a bit in the read set using FD_SET
	4) Use select to find out how many descriptors are ready.
	5) If the file descriptor is in the readset, complete the transaction
