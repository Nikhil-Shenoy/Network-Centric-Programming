what you will design and/or implement and how you will approach it)

DESIGN GOAL:

Our project idea is too create a multiuser game on a portable ad hoc network. The game in 
question is mafia. It is a turn based game with a focus on discussion and byzantine schemes.
Every player logins into the system and is given a role. The roles include but are not limited to
mafia, policeman, doctor, and townsperson. each role has their own special ability and their own goals.
The game is completed when all of the "bad" people are eliminated or all the "good" people are eliminated.

APPROACH OF IMPLEMENTATION:
The networking portion should be implemented using a TCP connection, and each user shall connect from a specialized
client. The server will start a game and choose from a pool of particpants to randomly assign roles. The game
will proceed as a series of round until a win condition is satisfied. One order of round progression is:
Narrator
Doctor
Mafia
Policeman
Townsperson
At each round the various roles have a chance to use their special abilities. The narrator can go on a rant,
the mafia can mark someone for death, the policeman can search for the mafia, and during the townsperson round 
everyone can talk and choose a person to mob. Upon elimination the user will be unable to act but can watch the game
unfold with full knowledge of all the users roles. The managment of the game shall be handled by the server, with it
timing and ending the rounds by broadcasting instructions to the client, such as removing their ability to talk. The server 
can boot players it deems disruptive and ban their IP and port number by entering them into a blacklist.
